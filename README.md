Use Databinding in gradle file to easy way integrate xml into kotlin file

Use Material 3 design for UI

create class NotesData with companion object and it will store column name of table and create table query.

Create NoteViewActivity. It will show while reminder notification is turned up and user click on notification. It will also show when click on Note in recyclerView. After clicking on notification NoteViewActivity should be open with full description of that note. 

Note should be deleted by clicking on icon of Delete. Note should not be added if any one field of note is empty.

Some notes have reminder time so add reminder time in alarmManager with note id & it should be receive in broadcast receiver & in broadcast receiver notification should be generated with title & description of note.
